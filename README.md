# Pathological-Myopia-Diagnosis-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project is based on my original work, initially created to practice my skills. In this repository, I have retained the original version while simplifying the code and providing a revised version with the suffix 1. The files with the 1 suffix implement a 2-class SqueezeNet model, which demonstrates better stability and higher predictive accuracy, aligning more closely with my dataset. In contrast, the original version uses a 4-class model, which does not correspond correctly to the dataset's label categories.
